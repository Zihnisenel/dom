The dataset includes 4349 images.
Domates are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Random shear of between -11° to +11° horizontally and -12° to +12° vertically
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.1 pixels
